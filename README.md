# Job Openings WebPage

- In this project, I created mainly two web pages. One for job applicants and one for recruiters
- Job Applicants: https://jobopenings.web.app/
- Recruiters: https://jobopenings.web.app/recruiter

### Job Applicants Page

- This page is for the job applicants. It displays the job that recruiter adds in recruiter page.
- It have a nav header, carousel, job container, about, contact and footer
- Jobs will be displayed according to the Job Type: Student Internship or Graduate Internship
- Jobs are sorted in the order of Job Category
- Application form for applying the job adds the applicants data in firestore database

### Recruiters Page

- This page have a form that adds the job details to the firestore database
- It updates by default in the applicants page
- Job Applications page displays the applicants details
